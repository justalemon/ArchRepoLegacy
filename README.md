# Lemon's Arch Repo<br>[![GitHub Actions][actions-img]][actions-url] [![Patreon][patreon-img]][patreon-url] [![PayPal][paypal-img]][paypal-url] [![Discord][discord-img]][discord-url]

This is my little Arch Repo with all of the Arch Linux packages I work on. They are meant to work on Arch Linux, but they also work on other Arch forks and derivatives.

## Installation

Add the following lines to your `/etc/pacman.conf`:

```ini
[lemon]
SigLevel = Optional DatabaseOptional
Server = https://github.com/justalemon/Arch/raw/master/$arch
```

## Usage

Just run `pacman -Syy`, then install any of the packages.
